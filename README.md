# elmar.dev

My personal website. If you need it, fork it! I'm using [Nx](https://nx.dev) with the Angular plugin. View the running version / demo [here](https://elmar.dev)

## Development server

Run `ng serve elmardotdev` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build elmardotdev` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

Visit the [Nx Documentation](https://nx.dev/angular) to learn more.
